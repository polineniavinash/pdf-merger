## PDF Merger

# Merge Multiple PDFs into One PDF Locally

In a world where data privacy is paramount, relying on online services to handle your sensitive documents can be risky. This simple Python script allows you to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF locally on your machine, ensuring your data remains secure.

# Why Merge PDFs Locally?

	•	Data Privacy Concerns: Online platforms may not guarantee the security of your uploaded files.
	•	Avoid Paid Services: Many online PDF merging tools require payment for full functionality.
	•	Control Over Your Data: Keep your documents on your local machine without exposing them to potential threats.
	•	Simplicity and Efficiency: Perform tasks quickly without the need for internet access or advanced technical knowledge.

# Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.x installed on your system.
	•	pip package manager (usually comes with Python).

Instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux

Step 1: Install PyPDF2

Open your terminal or command prompt and run: pip install PyPDF2

Step 2: Prepare Your PDF Files

    •   Place all your PDF files in the same directory as the merge_pdfs.py script.
    •   Ensure they are named correctly, e.g., page1.pdf, page2.pdf, etc.
    •   Alternatively, provide full paths to the files if they are located elsewhere.
Step 3: Edit the Script to Reflect Your PDF Files

    •   Modify the pdf_files list in the script to match your actual PDF filenames and the desired order:
            pdf_files = ['/Users/avinash/Desktop/merge-files/Page-1.pdf', '/Users/avinash/Desktop/merge-files/Page-2.pdf', '/Users/avinash/Desktop/merge-files/Page-3.pdf', '/Users/avinash/Desktop/merge-files/Page-4.pdf', '/Users/avinash/Desktop/merge-files/Page-5.pdf']

Note: Use full file paths if your PDFs are in different directories.

Step 4: Run the Script

    •   Change the output_path variable if you want to specify a different name or location for the merged PDF:

            output_path = 'merged_output.pdf'
# Cautions

	•	File Paths: Ensure that the paths to your PDF files are correct to prevent errors.
	•	File Permissions: Make sure you have the necessary read permissions for the PDF files and write permissions for the output directory.
	•	Overwriting Files: If merged_output.pdf already exists, it will be overwritten without warning.

# Benefits of Local PDF Merging

In the era of Generative AI and increasing cybersecurity threats, it’s crucial to minimize the exposure of sensitive data. By processing documents locally:

	•	You Eliminate Third-Party Risks: No need to trust external websites with your data.
	•	Maintain Confidentiality: Sensitive information stays on your device.
	•	Empowerment Through Simplicity: With minimal technical knowledge, you can perform tasks efficiently.

# Future of Local Computing

As technology advances, local solutions are becoming more powerful and accessible. Simple tasks like merging PDFs can be done quickly on your machine, reducing reliance on internet-based services. This shift towards local computing aligns with the growing emphasis on data privacy and security.
